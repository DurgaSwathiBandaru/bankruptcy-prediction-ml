#  Bankruptcy Prediction using Machine Learning

This project focuses on predicting whether a company is likely to go bankrupt using key financial indicators. It uses machine learning techniques to classify companies as either at-risk or safe, enabling early interventions.

---

## Problem Statement
To build a predictive model that accurately detects companies at risk of bankruptcy based on financial metrics.

---

## Approach
- **EDA**: Explored financial data to identify correlations and trends.
- **Preprocessing**: Handled missing values and scaled features.
- **Modeling**: Trained Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost classifiers.
- **Imbalance Handling**: Applied SMOTE to balance the dataset.
- **Evaluation**: Compared models using accuracy, recall, and AUC scores.
